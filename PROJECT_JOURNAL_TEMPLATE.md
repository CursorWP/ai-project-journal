# 📝 Project Journal - AI Context Retention Template

> **Share this template with the world!** Help developers maintain better context with AI assistants.

---

## What is this?

This is a **project journal template** designed to help AI coding assistants (like Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot) maintain context across multiple sessions. Think of it as a "memory bank" for your AI pair programmer.

## Why use it?

AI assistants are powerful but have limited context retention between sessions. This journal helps:
- ✅ **Remember decisions** and why you made them
- ✅ **Track progress** across multiple work sessions
- ✅ **Maintain consistency** in code style and architecture
- ✅ **Onboard new AI sessions** quickly
- ✅ **Document your project's story** naturally

## How to use it

1. **Copy this template** to your project root as `PROJECT_JOURNAL.md`
2. **Fill in the sections** as you work
3. **Ask your AI assistant to update it** after each session
4. **Reference it** at the start of new sessions

## 📖 How to Use This Journal with AI

### Starting a New Session
1. Share this journal with your AI assistant
2. Say: "Read PROJECT_JOURNAL.md to understand our project context"
3. Continue where you left off!

### Ending a Session
1. Ask AI to update the journal with:
   - What was accomplished
   - Decisions made
   - Next steps
2. Save the updated journal

### Best Practices
- ✅ **Update frequently** - After each major feature or decision
- ✅ **Be specific** - Include file paths, code snippets, rationale
- ✅ **Track WHY** - Not just what, but why you chose it
- ✅ **Keep it readable** - Future you (and AI) will thank you
- ✅ **Version control** - Commit journal updates with your code

### Example AI Prompts
- "Update PROJECT_JOURNAL.md with today's progress"
- "Add our decision about [X] to the journal with rationale"
- "Review the journal and suggest what to work on next"
