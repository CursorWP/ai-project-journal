# 📝 AI Project Journal - Context Retention for AI Assistants

> Keep your AI coding assistant's memory alive across sessions!

## 🤔 The Problem

Working with AI assistants (Claude, ChatGPT, Copilot) is amazing, but they forget everything between sessions. You waste time re-explaining:
- What you're building
- Decisions you made
- Why you chose certain approaches
- Where you left off

## 💡 The Solution

A **Project Journal** - a simple markdown file that acts as your AI's memory bank!

## ✨ Features

- 📚 **Context Retention** - AI remembers past decisions
- 🎯 **Progress Tracking** - Document what you've built
- 💭 **Decision Log** - Record WHY you chose things
- 🔄 **Session Continuity** - Pick up right where you left off
- 🤝 **Team Friendly** - Onboard new developers (or AIs) instantly

## 🚀 Quick Start

1. **Download** `PROJECT_JOURNAL_TEMPLATE.md`
2. **Copy** it to your project root as `PROJECT_JOURNAL.md`
3. **Fill in** the sections as you work
4. **Update** it after each session

### Using with AI

**Starting a session:**
```
"Read PROJECT_JOURNAL.md to understand our project context"
```

**Ending a session:**
```
"Update PROJECT_JOURNAL.md with today's progress and decisions"
```

That's it! Your AI now has memory! 🧠✨

## 📖 What's Inside

The template includes sections for:
- 👥 Team & roles
- 🎯 Project overview
- 🛠️ Tech stack decisions
- ✅ Completed features
- 💡 Design rationale
- 📝 Session logs
- 🚀 Current status
- 📋 Next steps

## 💪 Real-World Example

We used this technique while building **Vibe CMS** - a social platform built with PHP and flat-file database. See `PROJECT_JOURNAL.md` for a complete real-world example!

## 🎯 Benefits

- ✅ **Save time** - Stop re-explaining everything
- ✅ **Better decisions** - Document your reasoning
- ✅ **Consistent code** - AI maintains your patterns
- ✅ **Easy onboarding** - New contributors get up to speed fast
- ✅ **Natural documentation** - Your journal IS your docs

## 🌟 Who This Is For

- Solo developers working with AI assistants
- Teams collaborating with AI coding tools
- Students learning to code with AI tutors
- Anyone building long-term projects with AI

## 📚 Examples & Tips

### Example AI Prompts
- "Review the journal and suggest what to work on next"
- "Add our decision about [X] to the journal with rationale"
- "Summarize this session for the journal"

### Best Practices
- Update frequently (after major features)
- Be specific (include file paths, snippets)
- Track WHY, not just what
- Commit journal updates with your code
